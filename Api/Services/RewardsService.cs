    * This method was not thread safe because using count++ operator whereas count is declared as static.
    * The issue is that the count variable is declared as static, which means it belongs to the class itself,
    * not to any instance of the class. However, it is being updated from an instance method CalculateRewards.
    * In C#, when a static field is updated from an instance method, it can lead to unexpected behavior,
    * especially in multi-threaded environments. This is because static fields are shared across all instances of the class,
    * and updating it from an instance method can cause conflicts between different instances. */
